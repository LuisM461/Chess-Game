# Chess-Game
This is my creation of the game Chess using SFML and C++

    My overall thought process is to be able to create the board in order to know how to assign the movements of each piece respectively.
I made the board with a map. This map maps (lol) the coordinate/pair (i,j) of each square on the board to a more easily known code in chess
such as A1, E4, H6, etc. From here my plan is to be able to then assign the movements of each piece. I'm not entirely sure exactly how to 
map the pieces but I will get there.
